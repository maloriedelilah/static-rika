// `site` MUST be a real absolute URL — jsonld.ts builds every absolute @id
// (author, book, series) off `import.meta.env.SITE`. An unset/placeholder
// site silently produces broken @ids that pass `astro build` but are wrong.
// It's ALSO what @astrojs/sitemap and src/pages/robots.txt.ts key off of
// (via Astro.site) — so fixing this one value up top is what keeps JSON-LD
// @ids, the sitemap, and robots.txt's Sitemap: line all in agreement.
//
// Tier 2 (contact form, now subscribe later): deliberately KEEPING
// `output: 'static'` rather than flipping to `output: 'server'` (contra an
// earlier plan noted here). Astro's own docs: 'static' mode "prerenders all
// pages by default... if none opt out." With the Cloudflare adapter
// installed, an individual route can still opt into on-demand rendering via
// `export const prerender = false` (see src/pages/api/contact.ts). That
// gives the form endpoints a real server to run in WITHOUT quietly turning
// every book/series/theme/hub page into a per-request Workers render —
// this repo's whole value proposition (a static site, zero origin-server
// cost for content pages) stays intact; only /api/* pays the SSR cost,
// because only /api/* actually needs it.
